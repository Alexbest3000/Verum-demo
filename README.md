# Verum

**Socio-Economic-Cognitive Anti-Virus**

**The Brutally Honest AI**

Verum is a multi-modal cognitive security ecosystem designed for the post-truth era. We’ve merged Visual Forensics, Semantic Audit, and Behavioral Profiling into a single "Firewall for the Mind."

**🛡️ What it does**

Verum protects users from deception across three critical layers:

    Visual: Deepfake and AI-generation detection using Logic and Computer Vision.

    Semantic: Real-time "Bullshit Detection" in text—identifying hidden risks, logical traps, and corporate gaslighting.

    Behavioral: A psychological profiler that reads between the lines to reveal hidden human intentions and manipulation.

### ⚠️ Source Code Status

**Closed Source / Proprietary**

The core logic resides in `verum_brain.js` (orchestration) and `engine.js` (signal analysis).
Due to intellectual property and security reasons, the source code is not published in this repository at the moment.
